# Obsidian Custom Bullet Lists Plugin

This plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) is for customizing bullet lists.

## ***It only works in Preview mode (at least currently)***

### In the settings menu:
- You can change the little bullets for each list type (- + *)
- You can set a uniform color for them.
